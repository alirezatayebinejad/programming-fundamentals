# 87 programming practices

in this repository you will see 87 small algorithmic programs which eveyone one of them focus on a specific part of programming fundumentals 
it is written in c++ but you can write in any language by yourself
programms are sorted by easy to hard to practice: variables, conditions, functions, loops etc.

## :heavy_check_mark: useful for who:

-   wants to grow your problem solving
-   get master at algorithmic thinking and programming fundumentals
-   wants to teach programming and need examples and practices

## :heavy_check_mark: how to use:

-   read the cpp file from first algorithm to another and try to figure out what does this algorithm do line by line the write down in a paper what it does then after 10 algorithm reading just start coding all of them in your favourit language like java, csharp, javascript ...
